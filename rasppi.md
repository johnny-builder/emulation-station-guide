# Johnny's guide for the perfect emulation station
Raspberry Pi's are great! you can do many, *many* things with it, but we chose to emulate classic consoles with it.

# Ingredients (Requirements)
1. A Raspberry Pi, I personally recommend a RPi 4 for this job, but you still can do that with a RPi 3.
2. A microSD card with 8GB or more (16GB recommended)
3. A computer
4. A USB game controller (or a keyboard, but still a game controller is better)
5. A monitor or TV (+ HDMI cable)
6. A USB-C charger if your RPi is 4 or newer
7. A micro USB charger if your RPi is 3 or older
8.
