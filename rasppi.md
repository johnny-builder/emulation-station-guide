# Johnny's guide for the perfect emulation station
Raspberry Pi's are great! you can do many, *many* things with it, but we chose to emulate classic consoles with it.

# Ingredients (Requirements)
1. A Raspberry Pi, I personally recommend a RPi 4 for this job, but you still can do that with a RPi 3.
2. A microSD card with 8GB or more (16GB recommended)
3. A computer
4. A USB game controller (or a keyboard, but still a game controller is better)
5. A monitor or TV (+ HDMI cable)
6. A USB-C charger if your RPi is 4 or newer
7. A micro USB charger if your RPi is 3 or older
8. At least a little bit of experience with computers

# Setup Guide
To start, go to your computer and visit this link below and download the Raspberry Pi Imager for your OS:
[![Imager - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/Imager-Downloads-blue?logo=raspberrypi)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
Next, on Operating System, hit Choose OS, Emulation and game OS, hit Recalbox and select the right version of your Raspberry Pi.
Now, plug in your microSD card and select it in Storage.
After you're done, hit Write, give some permissions (if required), now this is might take some time depending on your computer's speed, so you many want to watch some cat videos on the meanwhile.
When it's done, eject the microSD and plug it into your RPi, now just plug in everything but **lastly** your charger.
You may need to wait for some time.
When it's done it's you who decides what's next, like adding skins, games etc. But for now, we're done.
